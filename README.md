# VBA-Challenge
#Stock_Analysis

Guidance was recieved from a Tutor when refining my code for the Yearly Change column, Percentag Change column, the conditional formating logic, looping the macro through each worksheet, and creating the summaries. 

I also looked to Data Tell's VBA challenge code in order to trouble shoot and resolve the code for creating and calculating each summary correctly.
